      <p class="testing">No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be
        destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal and if
        they can't stop you then you become something
        else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.
